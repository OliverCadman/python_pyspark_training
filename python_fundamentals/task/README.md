# Python Fundamentals P1 - Challenge

## Create a simple calculator application

In this task, you are required to create the core functionality of a simple calculator application. The application should be able to handle the following operations:

- add
- subtract
- multiply
- divide
- pow2

This task is something which those who were interviewed by Aon were tasked to do during their interviews. With this in mind, use your knowledge and experience to develop a robust application using Python-oriented best practices, and consider how you would articulate your solution.
