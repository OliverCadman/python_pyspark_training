"""Section 1: Variables & Basic Operations"""
"""Variables are containers for storing data values"""

# Challenge 1: Store and Print a Variable
# Declare a variable called name and assign it your name. Then, print it.

# name = "Evelyn"
# print(f'My name is {name}')

# Challenge 2: Simple Math Operations
# Declare two numbers and print their sum, difference, and product.

num1 = 5
num2 = 2.0
print(f'The sum of {num1} + {num2} is {num1 + num2}')
print(f'The difference of {num1} - {num2} is {num1 - num2}')
print(f'The product of {num1} * {num2} is {num1 * num2}')

"""If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting"""

# Challenge 3: Swap Two Variables
# Swap the values of two variables without using a third variable.

# Initial values of variables
a = 5
b = 10

# Output before swapping
print("Before swapping:")
print(f"a = {a}, b = {b}")

# Swap the values without a third variable
a, b = b, a

# Output after swapping
print("\nAfter swapping:")
print(f"a = {a}, b = {b}")

"""Section 2: Loops & Iteration"""
# Challenge 4: Use a for loop to print numbers from 1 to 10.

for number in range(1, 11):
    print(number)

# Challenge 5: Multiplication Table
# Ask the user for a number and print its multiplication table up to 10.

# Step 1: Ask the user for a number
number = int(input("Enter a number to generate its multiplication table: "))

# Step 2: Print the multiplication table up to 10
print(f"Multiplication table for {number}:")

for i in range(1, 13): 
    result = number * i
    print(f"{number} x {i} = {result}")

# Challenge 6: Count Down from 10 to 1
# Use a while loop to count down from 10 to 1 and then print "Blast Off!".

# Step 1: Initialize the countdown starting number
count = 10

# Step 2: Use a while loop to count down
while count > 0:
    print(count) 
    count -= 1

print("Happy New Year!!")

"""Code Modularity in Python ðŸ§©

Code modularity refers to breaking a program into smaller, reusable, and 
independent modules to improve readability, maintainability, and reusability. 
In Python, modularity is achieved through functions, classes, modules, and packages"""

"""Section 3: Functions & User Input"""

# Challenge 7: Greeting Function
# Write a function called greet() that takes a name as an argument and prints "Hello, [name]!".

def greet(name):

# Challenge 8: Sum of First N Numbers
# Write a function sum_n(n) that returns the sum of all numbers from 1 to n.

# Challenge 9: Define the function to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit (celsius * 9/5) + 32

# Challenge 10: Simple Login System
""" Define a function login_system that:
    1) Takes a username and password as inputs.
    2) Validates them against stored values (e.g., a hardcoded username and password).
    3) Allows the user to attempt logging in multiple times until successful or they choose to quit"""
