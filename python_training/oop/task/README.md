# Python Fundamentals P2 - Challenge

## Extend your Calculator's capabilities

- Augment the Calculator class with the a method 'pow2', which raises the input to the power of two.
- Create a decorator function which checks if the arguments provided to the Calculator's methods can be parsed into a float. If there is an error, return a friendly error message.

- Stretcher task 1: Augment the Calculator application with the ability to keep track of the 'state' of calculations. For example, if a user performs a calculation, this 'state' is saved and used as the input to a subsequent calculation.

- Stretcher task 2: Augment the Calculator application further by creating a CLI interface which the user can interact with.

If tackling the stretcher tasks, consider how the code can be organised to make best use of OOP principles.
